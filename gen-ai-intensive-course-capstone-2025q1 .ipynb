Lead Time Safety Stock: Given the lead time of 29 days, you should maintain a safety stock that can cover at least this period. Once you have the demand data, calculate the average daily sales and multiply it by the lead time to get the safety stock level.\\n\\n3. Quality Control: With a defect rate of 0.2264103608499251%, you may need to work with Supplier 3 to improve quality control processes. Although the defect rate might seem low, it can still lead to customer dissatisfaction and returns, which incurs extra cost.\\n\\n4. Regular Review: Regularly review the lead time, stock levels, defect rate, and demand to ensure the inventory is managed optimally. \\n\\n5. Supplier Communication: Keep open lines of communication with Supplier 3.

Based on the available information, here are a few recommendations:\\n\\n1. Get Demand Data: First, it's important to get the demand data for the haircare product SKU0. Without knowing demand, it's impossible to accurately predict how long the current stock will last and when to reorder. \\n\\n2. Lead Time Safety Stock: Given the lead time of 29 days, you should maintain a safety stock that can cover at least this period. Once you have the demand data, calculate the average daily sales and multiply it by the lead time to get the safety stock level.\\n\\n3. Quality Control: With a defect rate of 0.2264103608499251%, you may need to work with Supplier 3 to improve quality control processes. Although the defect rate might seem low, it can still lead to customer dissatisfaction and returns, which incurs extra cost.\\n\\n4. Regular Review: Regularly review the lead time, stock levels, defect rate, and demand to ensure the inventory is managed optimally. \\n\\n5. Supplier Communication: Keep open lines of communication with Supplier 3. If the lead time consistently hinders your ability to maintain optimal stock levels, consider discussing ways to reduce it or explore alternative suppliers. \\n\\nRemember, these recommendations depend on the actual demand rate for the SKU0 product, which is currently not available.\n","1    SKU1   skincare         23     53     4.854068    N/A     Product skincare (SKU SKU1) from supplier Supplier 3 has a lead time of 23 days, current stock is 53 units, defect rate is 4.854068026388706%, and demand is N/A.  Based on the information provided, the following actions are recommended:\\n\\n1. Verify Demand: The demand for the skincare product is currently not available. It's crucial to determine the demand forecast to make an informed decision. Please reach out to the sales or marketing team to get these numbers.\\n\\n2. Assess Lead Time: The lead time from Supplier 3 is relatively long (23 days). If the demand is high and cannot be met within this lead time, consider finding an alternate supplier with a shorter lead time or negotiate a shorter lead time with the current supplier.\\n\\n3. Monitor Stock Levels: With a current stock of 53 units, it's important to monitor sales closely to avoid stockouts. If sales are quick and the lead time is long, you may need to increase your safety stock.\\n\\n4. Address Quality Issues: The defect rate of roughly 4.85% is a concern. This could potentially lead to customer dissatisfaction and returns, which would impact supply chain efficiency and costs. It's recommended to discuss this issue with the supplier and check if they can improve their quality control.\\n\\n5. Review Order Frequency: Depending on the demand and the lead time, you may need to adjust your order frequency to ensure that there's always sufficient stock available.\\n\\nRemember, the goal is to ensure that there is enough stock to meet demand without overstocking (which can lead to increased holding costs) or understocking (which can lead to missed sales opportunities). Once the demand data is available, it's advisable to use an inventory management model like EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) to optimize order quantities.\n","2    SKU2   haircare         12      1     4.580593    N/A      Product haircare (SKU SKU2) from supplier Supplier 1 has a lead time of 12 days, current stock is 1 units, defect rate is 4.580592619199229%, and demand is N/A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Based on the information provided, the following actions are recommended:\\n\\n1. Contact Supplier 1: Reach out to Supplier 1 to see if there is any possibility to reduce the lead time. A lead time of 12 days could potentially cause issues if the demand for the product increases.\\n\\n2. Safety Stock Calculation: Since the demand is N/A, it's crucial to calculate the safety stock to avoid stockouts. This can be done by considering factors like lead time, the defect rate, and forecasted demand (once available).\\n\\n3. Quality Control: A defect rate of 4.580592619199229% indicates a need for better quality control measures. Discuss this with the supplier to ensure the issue is addressed and to reduce future defect rates.\\n\\n4. Back-up Supplier: Consider identifying a back-up supplier as a contingency plan. This will help to ensure product availability in case of unexpected delays or quality issues with Supplier 1.\\n\\n5. Demand Forecasting: Although the current demand is N/A, it's important to start forecasting future demand based on historical data and market trends. This can help with better inventory planning and avoiding stockouts.\\n\\nPlease note these actions are based on the limited information available. For a comprehensive plan, more data points like historical demand, market trends, supplier reliability, etc. would be useful.\n","3    SKU3   skincare         24     23     4.746649    N/A      Product skincare (SKU SKU3) from supplier Supplier 5 has a lead time of 24 days, current stock is 23 units, defect rate is 4.74664862064775%, and demand is N/A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Given the current situation, here are the recommended actions:\\n\\n1. Connect with Supplier 5: Discuss the possibility of reducing the lead time. A lead time of 24 days may not be sustainable in the long run, particularly if demand increases.\\n\\n2. Stock Management: With current stock at 23 units, it's important to monitor the stock closely.

Since the demand is not available, we can't predict the exact units needed. However, considering the lead time of 28 days and the defect rate of 3.872047681482133%, we may want to consider placing an order to cover the lead time and defect rate. \\n\\nHere's a possible course of action:\\n\\n1. Calculate the average daily demand for SKU96 using historical data.\\n2. Multiply this figure by 28 (the lead time) to estimate the number of units needed.\\n3. Adjust for the defect rate by adding an additional 3.872% to the order.\\n\\nPlease note that without demand data, this recommendation is a rough, theoretical guide. It would be prudent to gather more up-to-date demand data for a more accurate decision.\n","61  SKU98   skincare         28     53     2.908122    N/A    Product skincare (SKU SKU98) from supplier Supplier 5 has a lead time of 28 days, current stock is 53 units, defect rate is 2.908122169351261%, and demand is N/A.                                                                                                                                     Since the demand for the skincare product (SKU SKU98) is not available, it's challenging to give a precise recommendation. However, here are a few general steps you can take:\\n\\n1. Calculate Demand: The first step is to estimate the demand. You can use historical sales data, market research, or sales forecasts to estimate this. If the demand is high, a lead time of 28 days might be too long and you need to renegotiate with Supplier 5 to shorten it.\\n\\n2. Analyze Current Stock: With 53 units in stock, calculate how long this will last based on the estimated demand. If the stock is sufficient to cover the lead time, no immediate action might be necessary.\\n\\n3. Consider the Defect Rate: With a defect rate of 2.908122169351261%, consider this when calculating the effective stock. You might need to order more to compensate for the defective units.\\n\\n4. Implement Safety Stock: To cushion against uncertainties in demand or supply, consider maintaining a safety stock level. This can be calculated based on lead time, demand variability, and service level required.\\n\\nIf the estimated demand is significantly higher than the current stock (considering the defect rate), or if the stock won't last until the next batch arrives (considering the lead time), you should consider placing an order with the supplier immediately.\\n\\nPlease note that these are general recommendations, and the actual strategy should be tailored based on your company's specific circumstances and tolerance for risk.\n","62  SKU99   haircare         29     55     0.346027    N/A   Product haircare (SKU SKU99) from supplier Supplier 2 has a lead time of 29 days, current stock is 55 units, defect rate is 0.3460272907055034%, and demand is N/A.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Since the demand is not specified, it's hard to make a precise recommendation. However, here are a few suggestions based on the information provided:\\n\\n1. Communication: Reach out to Supplier 2 to discuss the possibility of reducing the lead time. A 29 days lead time is quite long and may cause issues if demand suddenly increases.\\n\\n2. Buffer Stock: Given the lengthy lead time, you might want to consider increasing your buffer stock levels to protect against variability in demand. The current stock of 55 units may not be sufficient based on the lead time.\\n\\n3. Quality Control: A defect rate of 0.3460272907055034% is relatively low. However, continuous quality assurance processes should be in place to ensure that the defect rate doesn't increase.\\n\\n4. Demand Forecast: It is crucial to establish a demand forecast for this product. This will help you to better manage stock levels and lead times, and reduce the risk of stockouts or overstock.\\n\\n5. Supplier Diversification: If reducing the lead time with Supplier 2 isn't possible, consider diversifying your supplier base for this product. This could help to reduce lead times and ensure a more steady supply of product.\\n\\nRemember, these are general recommendations. For a more precise action plan, we would need to know the demand rate for this product and other factors such as storage capacity and cost considerations.\n","\n","[63 rows x 8 columns]"]},"metadata":{},"output_type":"display_data"}],"source":["from IPython.display import display\n","\n","pd.set_option(\"display.max_colwidth\", None)\n","pd.set_option(\"display.expand_frame_repr\", False)  # Prevent wrapping\n","display(results_df)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":3348682,"sourceId":5826483,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31012,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.17"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
